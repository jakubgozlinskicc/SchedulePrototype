Follow these instructions to set up and run the application on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js and npm (or Yarn) installed on your system.

Node.js

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/jakubgozlinskicc/SchedulePrototype.git
Navigate into the project directory:

Bash

cd schedule-app
(Replace schedule-app with the actual name of your project folder if it is different.)

Install the dependencies: Use your preferred package manager (npm is assumed here):

Bash

npm install
or, if you use Yarn:

Bash

yarn install
Running the Application
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the application:

Start the development server:

Bash

npm run dev
or, if you use Yarn:

Bash

yarn dev
The application should now be running! The console will usually display the address where you can view it (e.g., localhost:5173).
